			<h1>About Maprat</h1>
			<br />
			<i
				>Travel feels less like a desire for progress that pushes you forward and more like gravity
				that prevents you from staying. A call to adventure, to the unknown, and not only to see
				someone specific or to visit a particular place. An act performed purely for its own sake,
				serving no other purpose, existing solely for itself, like an essence.</i
			>
			<br /><br />

			I often find myself asking people about the places they've visited around the world, but I
			rarely get a clear answer. That's why I created Mapratâ€”to make it easy to save and share your
			travel history. It's made for travelers, wanderers, globetrotters, nomads whatever you want to
			call them.
			<br /><br />

			Enjoy!
