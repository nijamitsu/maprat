            Travel. The act of carrying your body from one place to another.
            The bearer and the load, the subject and the object, are the same thing.
            We often hear those who highly romanticize this act say things like this: <br><br>

            <i>"Travel feels less like a desire for progress that pushes you forward and more like gravity that prevents you from staying.
            A call to adventure, to the unknown, and not only to see someone specific or to visit a particular place.
            An act performed purely for its own sake, serving no other purpose, existing solely for itself, like an essence."</i><br><br>

            I like asking people about the places they've visited around the world, but I rarely get a clear answer.
            That's why I created this websiteâ€”to make it easy to save and share your travel history.
            It's made for travelers, wanderers, globetrotters, nomads whatever you want to call them.<br><br>

            I hope you like it and maybe even find it insprational to travel more.<br><br>

            Enjoy!
