			<h2 id="what-is-visa">What is a visa?</h2>
			<p>
				A visa is an official document that allows the holder to enter, stay, or leave a country for
				a certain period of time. It is issued by the destination country's government and may
				include rules about the duration of stay, permitted activities, and areas within the country
				that the individual may enter. Visas are often required for travel, work, study, or transit
				through a country.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2 id="what-is-tourist-visa">What is a tourist visa?</h2>
			<p>
				A tourist visa grants you permission to stay in or transit through a country for leisure
				purposes. Tourist visas specify the duration of stay, permitted activities, and areas within
				the country the individual may enter.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2 id="what-is-business-visa">What is a business visa?</h2>
			<p>
				A business visa allows you to stay, or transit through a country for business purposes.
				Business visas are often required for attending meetings, conferences, or conducting
				business activities in a foreign country.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2 id="what-is-student-visa">What is a student visa?</h2>
			<p>
				A student visa permits you to study in a country for educational purposes. Student visas are
				commonly required for enrolling in academic programs, including universities, colleges, or
				language schools, in a foreign country.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2 id="what-is-visa-free">What is visa free?</h2>
			<p>
				Visa free means you can enter, stay, or transit through a country without needing a visa.
				You can usually stay for a short time for tourism, business, or transit, but you still need
				a valid passport or ID.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2 id="what-is-visa-on-arrival">What is visa on arrival?</h2>
			<p>
				Visa on arrival allows you to obtain a visa when you arrive in a country, rather than
				applying for one beforehand. You will need to meet certain requirements, such as having a
				valid passport, proof of return travel, and sometimes a fee, depending on the country.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2 id="what-is-eta">What is an ETA?</h2>
			<p>
				An Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) is an entry requirement for visa-exempt foreign
				nationals, linked to your passport. It is a simple online application, often processed the
				same day.
